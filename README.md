A simple ray tracer that renders spheres, cylinders and planes. It reads a scene description.  
There is spot lights and ambient lighting and colors.  
The project description is in the pdf.

This project was written for and compiled on a Mac.  
make bonus  
./miniRT <scene>  
Scenes are in the scenes folder. Rendering might take a while (more than one minute). The scenes had to be written in a certain format, specified in the pdf.  
We use libmlx42 and that needs glfw. The mlx42 is downloaded automatically, glfw must be installed.

This project was a 42School project, we had to program according to a strict norm, for instance using only while loops, having only 25 lines per function etc.

This was a team project with the phenomenal Mohamed Ben Hassen (shoutout!). Mohammed programmed the camera, and I the colored the pixels.
